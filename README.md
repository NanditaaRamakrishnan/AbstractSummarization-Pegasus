## Abstractive Summarization
Text summarization aims at generating accurate and concise summaries from input document(s). In contrast to extractive summarization which merely copies informative fragments from the input, abstractive summarization may generate novel words. A good abstractive summary covers principal information in the input and is linguistically fluent.

Text summarization is classified into two types â€” Extractive and Abstractive Summarization.

Extractive Summarization: The extractive text summarization process extracts the main points of a text without any alteration to those points and rearranges the order of that points and the grammar to get the soul out of the summary.

Abstractive Summarization: Abstractive methods use advanced techniques to get a whole new summary. Some parts of this summary might not even appear within the original text. Instead, they produce a paraphrasing of the main contents of the given text, using a vocabulary set different from the original document. This is very similar to what we as humans do, to summarize.

A semantic representation of the document is created in our brains. Certain words are chosen from our everyday vocabulary that fits in the semantics, to create a short summary that represents all the points of the actual document. Developing such a summarizer involves using Natural Language Processing.
